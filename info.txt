This is new branch 2 created on 9th of April. This branch contains the following task planning algorithm:

- Use stacking information to modify the OR-Tools-generated sequence. Then use target occupancy (buffer) to decide which object to pick first from the given sequence (via iterating through the sequence, checking for each object's occupancy).

- Works for the following scenarios:
	1. All object positions occupied
	2. Some object positions occupied
	3. No object positions occupied
	4. Stacking 

- Buffer positions included
